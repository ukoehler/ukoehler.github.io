# Computing

These pages will collect tips for Git/GitHub, Raspberry Pi, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and other topics.

## Background

My interest in computing started during my physics studies at university around 1990. Since 1992 I have been using Linux at home (various versions of SUSE) on my desktops, as well as on embedded devices like the Pogo Plug, Odroid U3 and recently Raspberry Pi 4. I have pages with tips for Raspberry Pi and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed since those are neglected over Redhat and Debian / Ubuntu.

## Programming

Over the years I learned quite a number of programming languages:
- Assembler
- Pascal
- Basic
- Lisp
- C
- Perl
- Bash
- Java
- C++
- Python

C++ is the preferred programming language by far. I learned Python to a limited extend for machine learning with TensorFlow for image processing.

In my work as a senior software developer, as well as privately, I value (unit) testing and good documentation. Part of this goes back to experiences programming medical devices professionally. This does mean, that I aim for 100% code coverage in unit tests and the use of static code checks. Tips how to achieve these are also documented here. The unit testing system I developed at work is capable of running test on several operating systems, check code coverage and perform code quality checks. All that is stored in a distributed database and presented graphically. For private use, a simpler system should be sufficient.
